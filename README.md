## Description
It filters so called 'h-events' and extracts  
  properties/start  
  properties/end  
  properties/name  

It then splits the comma separated properties/name into a list and assumes that  
[0] = event description  
[1] = town  
[2] = country  

If the generated list has more than 3 values it tries to read an exception format file. It is comma seperated
a,b,c,d,e,f,g

with  
if (list[a] == b) and (list[c] == d) {  
	country = e;  
        state = f; //use 99 if not available  
	town = g;  
}  
example:  
3,United Kingdom,1,Edinburgh,3,2,1
